# STA141AFinalProject
[approved] CNNs for rice disease diagnosis

as of 6/11/23 this project has been finished and no further changes will be made to the code or report. Some code may deprecate in the future. 

Final project for the STA141A course. This is an alternate topic that was approved by the instructor. 

This project was created in colab, so it should be run in colab with a GPU runtime. 


The data file for this project is too large to include in the github. I have included the csv portions of the data, and can provide the image dataset upon request.
